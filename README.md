Clojars.org Leiningen Plugin
============================

This is a simple plugn for interacting with Clojars.org directly from 
Leiningen.

Setup
-----

Add lein-clojars as a Leiningen (1.x) plugin:

    lein plugin install lein-clojars 0.8.0

Or for Leiningen 2 add it to ~/.lein/profiles.clj:

    {:user {:plugins [[lein-clojars "0.8.0"]]}}

Create a Clojars account and paste your SSH public key into your [profile] [1].
If you don't have ssh-keygen available -- perhaps you're using Windows -- 
then you can use:

    lein keygen

SSH keys will searched for in ~/.leiningen and ~/.ssh under the names id_rsa,
id_dsa and identity.
